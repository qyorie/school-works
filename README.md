# Introduction
I created this repository to document all the projects that I 
(or we, if I am working on a group project) have completed throughout 
my college years at Partido State University. This will help me 
track my programming skills throughout my journey.

# 2nd Year Projects
- CC5 - A laundry tracking website we built together with my classmates as our class project.
- CSP3 - I program a Genetic Algorithm to solve Vertex Cover Problem.
