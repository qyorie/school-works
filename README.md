# Introduction
I created this repository to document all the projects I’ve completed during my 
time at Partido State University—whether individually or as part of a group. It 
serves as a record of my progress and a way to track the development of my programming 
skills throughout my college journey.

## LEGEND
👤 Solo\👥 Group

- CC5👥 - A laundry tracking website we built together with my classmates as our group project.
